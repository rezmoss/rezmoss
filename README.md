I've spent over two decades in technology, building and scaling platforms that serve real users and real businesses. My work sits at the intersection of systems architecture, security, and engineering leadership.

### What I Do
- Design and deliver scalable platforms using **Golang**, **Node.js**, and [AWS](https://builder.aws.com/community/@rezmoss)
- Lead engineering and security efforts focused on reliability and automation
- Contribute to open-source projects that strengthen cloud and developer ecosystems
- Mentor teams and engineers on building resilient, production-grade systems

### What Drives Me
A deep interest in systems thinking, developer enablement, and secure design.  
Whether guiding teams through scale challenges or exploring IoT integrations, I focus on connecting solid engineering practices to measurable outcomes.

### Outside of Work
Usually outdoors, experimenting with sensor projects or enjoying a good scotch.
