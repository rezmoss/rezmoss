👋 Rez Moss here

I’ve been building in tech for over two decades — not just writing code, but architecting systems, scaling businesses, mentoring teams, and solving real-world problems with cloud-native solutions.

- 💼 Tech Strategist & Systems Architect – I design and build scalable, cloud-based platforms using Golang, Node.js, and AWS.
- 🛠️ Builder at Heart – From early startups to large-scale systems, I’ve led engineering efforts that power serious production workloads.
- 📈 Beyond Dev – I think in terms of systems, products, and people. Whether it’s DevOps pipelines or business outcomes, I connect the dots.
- 🌍 Mentor & Collaborator – I guide devs, contribute to open-source, and love helping others grow in cloud infrastructure and software craft.
- 🔭 Always Evolving – Lately exploring serverless, container orchestration, and IoT — blending cloud with the physical world.
- 🏕️ Offline? Probably off-grid, prototyping something weird with sensors, or recharging outdoors.
